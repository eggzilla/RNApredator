<P>sRNAs are non-coding RNAs found in bacteria. sRNAs are very
heterogeneous both in sizes, structures and functions Most
of them act as post-transcriptional regulators by interacting
 with the 5' untranslated region of mRNA transcripts, modifying
 their stability and/or their ability to be translated. 
</P>
<P>The RNApredator software facilitates the prediction of sRNA-mRNA
interactions in bacteria. Currently targets can be searched in more
than 1300 bacterial species. RNApredator uses a dynamic programming
approach to compute putative targets. The main machinery used by
RNApredator to find targets is the program called  <A HREF="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/RNAplex/">RNAplex</A>.
RNAplex is a new approach for RNA-RNA interaction search, which has
a prediction accuracy  similar to that of algorithms that explicitly consider intramolecular
 structures, but running at least three orders of magnitude faster than RNAup and IntaRNA. This is achieved
by using a combination of pre-computed accessibility profiles, with an approximate energy-
model, allowing to mimic the effects of the competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions.
The addition of the accessibility information into the computation of the sRNA-mRNA interactions allows to improve the specificity as very
structured targets are discarded.</P>

	Top: In algorithm like TargetRNA or RNAhybrid, the energy gained<br>
	by adding a base-pair (i,j) to an existing duplex (S(i,j;i-1,j+)<br>
	does not take the energy necessary to free base-pairs i and j <br
	from all the intramolecular interactions they are involved in. <br>
	Bottom:
	For each nucleotide added to the duplex, the energy necessary<br>
	to remove the nucleotide from all its intramolecular interactions (d<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>x</SUP>,
	d<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>y</SUP>)<br> is taken into account. This allows to
	reach a greater specificity in the target predictions.</I></FONT>

<P>Besides the raw prediction of binding partners, RNApredator allows
the analysis of the results in different post-processing steps. It is
possible to look at enriched GO terms/pathways in a set of
user-selected targets. Furthermore RNApredator offers the user the
possibility to look at the difference of accessibility around the
ribosome binding site before and after binding of the sRNA to its
target, which is useful when the user wants to know the sRNA will up
or downregulate its target.</P>
